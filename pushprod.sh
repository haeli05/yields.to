# 2. Checkout main, pull latest, merge current branch, and push
# 3. Return to your original branch

#   ./git-auto-merge.sh
#
# Make sure you have no uncommitted changes you want to keep unstaged!

# Exit on any error

# 3. Merge the feature branch into main and push
git merge "$current_branch"
git push

# 4. Return to the original branch
git checkout "$current_branch"

echo "âœ… Workflow complete! You are back on $current_branch."
